# My 100 days of contributing to Open Source Projects.

In this repository, I will be documenting my 100 days journey of progress on this wonderful words that is open - source.


## Why I decided to start open source ?

As you probably know, I am not one of those kids that started coding at 3 years old and know it all when it comes to programming. Even though my passion for love for computer and digital stufs started way back when I was in elementary school, I did not start writing my fist code until 6 years ago (with html :)). Even so, I seriously started to code only 2 years ago when I added Computer Engineering & Electronic Systems as my 2nd major. I then started learning groovy, but I rapidly switched to C/++. 


Back to the question, since I got serious about coding. I did not really build things from scratch. I have always been relaying on publicly available projects tha someone somewhere in a book or in youtube introduced to me. I did not come up with all the answers. Now thinking about it, there was always someone somewhere contributing or maintaining those projects for the world to use, **FOR FREE**. That, my friend, is open source. Now that I am becoming a better programmer, I can't be anything but grateful to all those people.

Last month, I heard about the [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) 2022, a challenge that brings together the global community of coder or any tech enthousiast interested in giving back to the community by contributing to any open source project.


This is the biggest motivation I have ever had. If thos Youtube can contribute to the fondation of our technologies today, whu can't i? Here I am now challenging myself.

But As you know, I am probably not the best coder yer, so I will help contribute with what I can: translation, design, typo fixes, and code sometimes.

I hope this journey will be filled with a lot of teacheable moment, meeting with wonderful human being and outstanding project to to make a better world \:)

# Day 8/100:

### Progress:

Worked on the Developer Quiz site by Free code camp. I also got to know that in the beginning we were worried that we might not have full propretary right to use the different library, snipet of code or anything like that, but I  came accross what was called the GNU and th MIT license. I understood that those license are all free to use but there is a huge huge difference. GNU GPL license does not allow the person who use it to pursue a full propretary project. All the projects that people are




# DAy 7/100:

# Day 6/100:

## Day 4/100:

### Progress :

Today, I was supposed to work an open source project, but I  opened an issue into the wepo homepage. I was using and alert to notify the user that they have submitted a form, but after more reading I came across a library called toastr. A JavaScript library that is used for displaying alert messages. I opened an issue about that and labelled it as good first issue and I got someone suggesting to help implementing that into our project.
I assigned that issue to him.

### Thoughts: 

Okay, Not be a lazy programmer but I was planning to work on that issue on my own, I did not know that issues can be discovered so easily. The was very diligent. He even suggested to use a react-toastify library, which similar to toastr but works better on react  projects et even refactored some of my code.

### Thoughts :

## Day 3/100:

### Progress:

Today I worked on an online shared clipboard project. It is a project that help people share their clipboard with other people through a link. After checking the project, I noticed that the button ( submit button as well as another button where not well styled: the text color was similar to the background and it was not interactive enough). 

### Thoughts:

This was the first time for me to work on a php web project. So, I had to do some research about how to run a php file locally. (Which I did not succeed doing. I just ended up copying the html code and creating another index.html file to be able to apply the styling. Even though I lost a lot of time trying to set up the environment for the pho I was not able to successfully do that ðŸ˜‚. It was a nice try though.

## Day 2/100:

### Progress:

Today I worked on the homepage of Lokole. By providing the support into adding an SSL certificate to protect their websites. 

### Thoughts:

At first, I thought that they will be assigning me that responsibility to encrypt the HTTPS, but things did not work out as I planned. I just provided the link explaining how to proceed to restore the HTTPS encryption.


## Day 1/100:

### Progress:

Today I worked on a project and I contributed by providing the french translation of the project.


### Thoughts:


At first, I thought this will be easy given that there was already translation in French from France and in French from Canada. But after checking, I noticed that those translations were outdated in comparaison to the original English file. Do I had to go through to all the untranslated sentences and expressions, add them myself and translated them into French from DRCongo.

Great
