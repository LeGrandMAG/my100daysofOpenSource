# My 100 days of contributing to Open Source Projects.

In this repository, I will be documenting my 100 days journey of progress on this wonderful words that is open - source.


## Why I decided to start open source ?

As you probably know, I am not one of those kids that started coding at 3 years old and know it all when it comes to programming. Even though my passion for love for computer and digital stufs started way back when I was in elementary school, I did not start writing my fist code until 6 years ago (with html :)). Even so, I seriously started to code only 2 years ago when I added Computer Engineering & Electronic Systems as my 2nd major. I then started learning groovy, but I rapidly switched to C/++. 


Back to the question, since I got serious about coding. I did not really build things from scratch. I have always been relaying on publicly available projects tha someone somewhere in a book or in youtube introduced to me. I did not come up with all the answers. Now thinking about it, there was always someone somewhere contributing or maintaining those projects for the world to use, **FOR FREE**. That, my friend, is open source. Now that I am becoming a better programmer, I can't be anything but grateful to all those people.

Last month, I heard about the [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) 2022, a challenge that brings together the global community of coder or any tech enthousiast interested in giving back to the community by contributing to any open source project.


This is the biggest motivation I have ever had. If thos Youtube can contribute to the fondation of our technologies today, whu can't i? Here I am now challenging myself.

But As you know, I am probably not the best coder yer, so I will help contribute with what I can: translation, design, typo fixes, and code sometimes.

I hope this journey will be filled with a lot of teacheable moment, meeting with wonderful human being and outstanding project to to make a better world \:)
