# My 100 days of contributing to Open Source Projects.

In this repository, I will be documenting my 100 days journey of progress on this wonderful words that is open - source.


## Why did I decide to start open source ?

As you probably know, I am not one of those kids that started coding at 3 years old and know it all when it comes to programming. Even though my passion for love for computer and digital stufs started way back when I was in elementary school, I did not start writing my fist code until 6 years ago (with html :)). Even so, I seriously started to code only 2 years ago when I added Computer Engineering & Electronic Systems as my 2nd major. I then started learning groovy, but I rapidly switched to C/++. 


Back to the question, since I got serious about coding. I did not really build things from scratch. I have always been relaying on publicly available projects tha someone somewhere in a book or in youtube introduced to me. I did not come up with all the answers. Now thinking about it, there was always someone somewhere contributing or maintaining those projects for the world to use, **FOR FREE**. That, my friend, is open source. Now that I am becoming a better programmer, I can't be anything but grateful to all those people.

Last month, I heard about the [**Hacktoberfest**](https://hacktoberfest.com/) 2022, a challenge that brings together the global community of coder or any tech enthousiast interested in giving back to the community by contributing to any open source project.


This is the biggest motivation I have ever had. If those Youtubers can contribute to the fondation of our technologies today, whu can't i? Here I am now challenging myself.

But As you know, I am probably not the best coder yer, so I will help contribute with what I can: translation, design, typo fixes, and code sometimes.

I hope this journey will be filled with a lot of teacheable moment, meeting with wonderful human being and outstanding project to to make a better world \:)

## Day 10/100 October 19th:

### Progress:

I just got a feedback from another contributors of the **Milan Project**. TIL that it is best practice to wrap you <a> in the h element and not the opposite. Also, I jut got my first ever [LGTMðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰](https://github.com/IAmTamal/Milan/pull/500#issuecomment-1283556823) . More dopamine!
  
Might contribute to other open source projects later today, but let's see.
  
### Thoughts:
  

## Day 9/100 October 18th:

### Progess:

I worked on the [Milan Project](https://github.com/IAmTamal/Milan). Today's work was mostly fixing the README markdown file. I have been using markdown on a daily basis so I was able to fix all the link as required by the issue ([#494](https://github.com/IAmTamal/Milan/issues/494)). 

Thoughts October 17th: 

The original README file was associating some HTML but I personally thing that is much faster to write directly in markdown.

## Day 8/100 October 16th:

### Progress:

Today, I worked on the [Developer Quiz Project](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/Developer_Quiz_Site) by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). It is an open-source project made of over 900 questions in python, sql, javascript DevOps, QA for helping the community test their skills and learn new concepts. My contribution was mostly about refactoring the Hero section as well as the styling as raised by the following issue ([#416](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/Developer_Quiz_Site/issues/416)).

I also got to know that in the beginning we were worried that we might not have full propretary right to use the different library, snipet of code or anything like that, but I  came accross what was called the GNU and th MIT license. I understood that those license are all free to use but there is a huge huge difference. Projects or source with a GNU GPL license does not allow the person who uses them to build something with a commercial purpose. For instance, Project G is the GNU GPL licensed project. Even though any developer or software engineer around the world can freely use them in their GX project, their project is automatically inheriting from the GNU license from project G, and should not mbe commercialized. To cut it short GNU project limits dev from using them from commercial purpose, it fully open-source all the way in. Whereas MIT Licensed project give does not hinder people from using them in commercial software. For instance if someone somewhere build made a Project M under MIT license, no matter who uses it in their Project MX, they have the freedom to use it in anyway possible.

### Thoughts:

I am currently working in the developer team on a mobile marketplace for second-hand products in Congo called WEPO. Even though their are things that we are trying to build from scratch, there have been many libraries, frameworks, snipet of codes that we are integrating to our code. We were worried that we might not be able to License our software but after today's work on open source, I think we should be careful about the code we are using for some snipet of codes, library or framework cannot be used, multiplied or distributed for commercial-use.


## Day 7/100 October 15th:

### Progress : 

Today I did not contribute to any project. I took a break from programming.
  
### Thoughts:
Nothing really, Nothing to share lol.

## Day 6/100 October 14th:
  
### Progress : 
Today, I still worked on the **Conception Project** but, this time, I did not raise any issue. I just contributed by submitting a project ideas. But unfortunately my code did not get merged yet. You can find my PR request at the link below [here](https://github.com/roopeshsn/conception/pull/19)


### Thoughts:

It is always a new experience to work with people with different perspectives, and different priority, that's is also the beauty of Open Source.

## Day 5/100 October 13th:

### Progress: 

Today, I worked on designing the logo for the **Conception Project**. It is a web application woking as a directory for  app ideas as well as college project ideas. I noticed that the application did not have any favicon on its own. Instead, it was using Vercel's native favicon, lol. So, I opened an issue ([#17](https://github.com/roopeshsn/conception/issues/17)), designed a logo using figma. Actually coming up with the logo was super easy. As the project concept is pretty clear to me "Directory of ideas" ==> I focused only on the concept **IDEA**. When I think of an idea I can easily illustrate it using the light bulb.I also used one of Figma's well-known plugin that turn any square frame into an ico file. ".icon" are the most used file for favicon. I also made a PNG file (with a transpaerent background) just in case he might be interested in adding it in his branding.

Here is a picture with  on the right the vercel native favicon, and on the left the icon I designed.

### Thoughts:

This project was pretty hard to work for two reasons: Firstly, When I made my first commit, it seemed like the automation he has built has some issue and does deploy the app correctly. I am not even sure whether my change will be merge into production. Secondly, He was super rude, lol. Some people can be super mean when they work for free, lol.

## Day 4/100 October 12th:

### Progress :

Today, I was supposed to work on an open source project, but I got to experience as an maintener instead. I opened an issue into the wepo homepage. I was using and alert to notify the user that they have submitted a form, but after more reading I came across a library called toastr. A JavaScript library that is used for displaying alert messages. I opened an issue about that and labelled it as good first issue and I got someone suggesting to help implementing that into our project.
I assigned that issue to him.

### Thoughts: 

Okay, Not be a lazy programmer but I was planning to work on that issue on my own, I did not know that issues can be discovered so easily. The was very diligent. He even suggested to use a react-toastify library, which similar to toastr but works better on react  projects et even refactored some of my code.


## Day 3/100 October 11th:

### Progress:

Today I worked on an online shared Clipboard project. It is a project that help people share their clipboard with other people through a link. After checking the project, I noticed that the button (submit button as well as another button where not well styled: the text color was similar to the background and it was not interactive enough). More details on that can be found on the issue [#60](https://github.com/fadkeabhi/CLIPBOARD/issues/60).
  
 I made my PR (pull request) can be found [here](https://github.com/fadkeabhi/CLIPBOARD/pull/68).

### Thoughts:

This was the first time for me to work on a php web project. So, I had to do some research about how to run a php file locally. (Which I did not succeed doing. I just ended up copying the html code and creating another index.html file to be able to apply the styling. Even though I lost a lot of time trying to set up the environment for the pho I was not able to successfully do that ðŸ˜‚. It was a nice try though.
  
  

## Day 2/100 October 10th:

### Progress:

Today I worked on the homepage of Lokole Project from Ascoderu. Lokole is a project made by some wonderful human being in Canada willing to provide access to communications to marginalized people in Congo.  By providing the support into adding an SSL certificate to protect their websites. 

  My issue can be found [here](https://github.com/ascoderu/ascoderu.github.io/issues/25#issuecomment-1272299705).

### Thoughts:

At first, I thought that they will be assigning me that responsibility to encrypt the HTTPS, but things did not work out as I planned. I just provided the link explaining how to proceed to restore the HTTPS encryption. I did not make any pull directly but I raised an issue that raised the maintainers attention.

## Day 1/100 October 9th:

### Progress:

Today I worked on a project and I contributed by providing the french translation of the project.

  My pull reqeust can be found [here](My pull request can be found [here](https://github.com/CyBear-Jinni/cbj_app/pull/503).

### Thoughts:

At first, I thought this will be easy given that there was already translation in French from France and in French from Canada. But after checking, I noticed that those translations were outdated in comparaison to the original English file. Do I had to go through to all the untranslated sentences and expressions, add them myself and translated them into French from DRCongo.
